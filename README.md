A small web design stuff using AJAX and php

Its not very large type project. A small example of AJAX.

# AJAX
AJAX is a Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. Easy to use and implement. With jquery it is much easier.
It is not a programming language. It uses combination of xmlhttprequest to request data from server and uses javascript and html dom to display data to the client.

-> Simply means, we can update parts of data or webpage without reloading the whole webpage with the help of using AJAX.

-> Asynchronously exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes, without affecting the rest of the page.
